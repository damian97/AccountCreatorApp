# AccCreatorApp ![This is an image](Tibia_icon.png)

I am creating this program for people who like play in Tibia and often have to create new accounts :D 

This code will create an account for you on Tibia.com and o2.pl, confirm your email and enter your R'Key.
Finally, it will save the login details in a text file in MyDocuments.

## ⚠️⚠️⚠️ The program takes control over the mouse and keyboard. ⚠️⚠️⚠️ ##
⚠️ It is not recommended to use the mouse or enter text on the keyboard while the program is running. ⚠️

## A browser installed on your computer is required for the program to work properly.

## Supported browsers:  Google Chrome✅, FireFox❌, Opera❌, Internet Explorer❌
