# AccCreatorApp ![This is an image](Tibia_icon.png)

I am creating this program for people who like play in Tibia and often have to create new accounts :D 

This code will create an account for you on Tibia.com and o2.pl, confirm your email and enter your R'Key.
Finally, it will save the login details in a text file in MyDocuments.

The program takes control over the mouse and keyboard, so while the program is running, do not move the mouse or enter data on the keyboard.

## A browser installed on your computer is required for the program to work properly.

## Supported browsers:  Google Chrome✅, FireFox❌, Opera❌, Internet Explorer❌
    
❇️ *How to use it?*

‼️ *Requirements:*

- **You need install Java on your computer.** *This site was built using [GitHub Pages](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html)*
